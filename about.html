    <h1>Oldest Bridges</h1>

    <p>
        The Karamagara Bridge was built sometime in the 5th or 6th century during the era of the Byzantine Empire. The bridge consisted of a single pointed arch and is possibly the earliest known example of a pointed arch bridge.
        <br>
        Karamagara Bridge was part of larger Roman road that led to the city of Melitene in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey. The bridge is no longer usable today because it was submerged after the completion of the Keban Dam in 1975. Before this, Karamagara Bridge was examined by the Middle East Technical University of Ankara.

        How TO Constrauct the Bridge
    </h1>

    <p>
        bridge, structure that spans horizontally between supports, whose function is to carry vertical loads. The prototypical bridge is quite simple—two supports holding up a beam—yet the engineering problems that must be overcome even in this simple form are inherent in every bridge: the supports must be strong enough to hold the structure up, and the span between supports must be strong enough to carry the loads. Spans are generally made as short as possible; long spans are justified where good foundations are limited—for example, over estuaries with deep water.
        <br>
        All major bridges are built with the public’s money. Therefore, bridge design that best serves the public interest has a threefold goal: to be as efficient, as economical, and as elegant as is safely possible. Efficiency is a scientific principle that puts a value on reducing materials while increasing performance. Economy is a social principle that puts value on reducing the costs of construction and maintenance while retaining efficiency. Finally, elegance is a symbolic or visual principle that puts value on the personal expression of the designer without compromising performance or economy. There is little disagreement over what constitutes efficiency and economy, but the definition of elegance has always been controversial.

        A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water, valley, road, or rail) without blocking the way underneath. It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, which is usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross. There are many different designs of bridges, each serving a particular purpose and applicable to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on factors such as the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, and the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.

        The Podilskyi Bridge (Ukrainian: Подільський мостовий перехід), also known as Podilsko-Voskresenskyi Bridge (Ukrainian: Подільсько-Воскресенський міст), is a combined road-rail bridge over the Dnipro River under construction in Kyiv, Ukraine.[3][4] It is a focal point of construction of the Podilsko-Vyhurivska Line of the Kyiv Metro.[5]
        <br>
        The two-level and 7 km (4 mi)-long bridge is intended to carry part of the future Podilsko-Vyhurivska Line of the Kyiv Metro and three lanes of road traffic in each direction, connecting the central Podil neighborhood to the left-bank parts of the city. The top level of the bridge will carry road traffic, while the bottom will carry rail traffic.
